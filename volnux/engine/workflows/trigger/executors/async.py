"""

AsyncTaskWorkflowExecutor — executes workflows as asyncio Tasks in the
current event loop.

Design contract
---------------
WorkflowExecutors are NOT event/task executors. They sit one level above:

    TriggerEngine fires
        └── WorkflowExecutor.execute(workflow_name, params)
                └── WorkflowConfig.run_workflow_async(params)
                        └── Coordinator + Flow Selector + EventExecutors

WorkflowExecutors control:
    - How many workflows run simultaneously (concurrency cap)
    - Whether execution is sync (caller waits) or async (fire-and-forget)
    - Timeout enforcement at the workflow level
    - Cancellation of in-flight workflows by name or execution ID

They do NOT control how individual events within a workflow are dispatched
(that is the EventExecutor's job — AsyncTaskExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor,
RustExecutor, etc.).

AsyncTaskWorkflowExecutor specifics
------------------------------------
Each workflow becomes an asyncio Task in the same event loop. No external
infrastructure needed. Suitable for:

    - Development and single-process deployments
    - I/O-bound workflows (the majority)
    - When lowest trigger-to-execution latency is required
    - When process isolation is not needed

For CPU-bound workflows use ProcessWorkflowExecutor.
For distributed execution use CeleryWorkflowExecutor or KubernetesWorkflowExecutor.

    Executes workflows as asyncio Tasks in the same event loop.

    Concurrency
    -----------
    ``max_concurrent`` limits the number of simultaneously running workflows.
    When the limit is reached:
        - ``execute()`` suspends the caller until a slot opens.
        - ``execute_background()`` schedules the workflow as a background Task
          that starts when a slot opens, and returns an execution ID
          immediately without blocking the caller.

    Triggers that want fire-and-forget semantics should use
    ``execute_background()``. Callers that need the workflow result should
    use ``execute()``.

    Timeout
    -------
    ``timeout`` applies at the WORKFLOW level, not the event level. A workflow
    that exceeds the timeout is cancelled — all running events within it
    receive CancelledError and checkpoint before stopping.

    Cancellation
    ------------
    Cancellation via ``cancel_workflow()`` awaits the task's completion so
    that callers receive control only after the workflow has fully stopped and
    its cleanup has run. This prevents the race where ``cancel_workflow()``
    returns but the task is still running.
