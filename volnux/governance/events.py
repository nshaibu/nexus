"""The governance event contract.

A ``GovernanceEvent`` is a single fact the engine reports for the platform to
project (an execution started, a task completed, a node beat). It is a
transport-agnostic message: it mixes in the engine's messaging integration and
is delivered through whatever backend the deployment has provisioned (Redis,
Postgres, in-memory, ...), keyed by ``get_schema_name()``. There is no Redis or
any other transport hard-wired here.

The pattern mirrors ``volnux.backends.saga._dlq.DeadLetterEntry``: a model that
mixes in ``MessagingBackendIntegrationMixin``, which itself extends
``KeyValueStoreIntegrationMixin``, so the event is both persistable and
publishable/queueable from one base. The reporter enqueues events with
``GovernanceEvent.enqueue(event)`` and a consumer drains them with
``GovernanceEvent.dequeue()`` over the same configured backend.

The structured ``payload`` (status, error, node metrics, HITL prompt, ...) is a
plain mapping and stays one the whole way across: producers build a dict,
consumers read a dict, and the model layer handles coercion and serialisation.
