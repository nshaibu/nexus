"""Bridge the engine's in-process lifecycle signals to governance events.

The engine already fires a rich set of ``volnux.signal.signals`` at every
lifecycle boundary: a pipeline run starting and ending, each task starting,
finishing and retrying, and a task suspending for human input. This module
subscribes to those signals, translates each into a validated
``GovernanceEvent``, and hands it to a ``GovernanceEventPublisher`` that delivers
it off the hot path over whatever messaging backend the deployment has
provisioned.

Three properties are load-bearing and deliberate:

* **Opt-in.** Nothing here runs unless ``install_governance_reporter`` (or
  ``SignalGovernanceReporter.install``) is called. If it is never installed, the
  signals simply have no listener and the engine behaves exactly as it does
  standalone.

* **Non-blocking and exception-isolated.** Translation is cheap and happens
  inside ``_emit``'s guard, so a validation failure is logged and dropped rather
  than raised into the run; the actual send is deferred to the publisher's
  background thread, so a slow or failing transport never disturbs a running
  workflow. Reporting is observational.

* **Retained for the process lifetime.** The signal system holds listeners by
  *weak reference*. On ``install`` the reporter registers itself in a module-level
  strong-reference registry, so it survives for the process lifetime even if the
  caller does not keep the returned instance; ``uninstall`` releases it.

Correlation
-----------
Every event is correlated by ``execution_id = pipeline.id``. One ``Pipeline``
instance corresponds to one run, and ``Pipeline`` exposes ``change_object_id()``,
so when the platform backend dispatches a run it can stamp the governance
``Execution`` id onto the pipeline, and every event this reporter emits then
carries that exact id. Run standalone, the id is simply the engine's own
pipeline id.
